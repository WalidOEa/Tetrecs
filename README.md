# Tetrecs
## About
Tetrecs is a Tetris-like game based around placing objects onto a grid and clearing lines both vertically and horizontally. The goal is to clear as many lines as you can before running out of lives. 

## How To Play
The aim of the game is to clear as many lines as possible either horizontally or vertically by placing 15 different blocks around a 5 by 5 grid. You can view a preview of the two upcoming blocks and switch between them, allowing for flexibility in playstyle. The blocks can also be rotated around the grid. There are also powerups that will aid you in various ways such as: clearing the grid of blocks, an extra live and an increased multipler. For each 1000 points, you go up a level where the timer gets increasingly quicker as you race against the clock.
